# SMS Spam Detection

This repository contains the SMS Spam Detection project, which uses machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging Python and relevant libraries for natural language processing (NLP) and classification tasks.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares SMS messages for machine learning.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or other NLP-based methods.
- **Model Training:** Trains machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to classify messages.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - sklearn
  - nltk

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SMS_Spam_Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SMS_Spam_Detection
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook T_VIJAYSHREE_(SMS_SPAM_DETECTION)_CODSOFT.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Load the dataset
   - Preprocess the SMS messages
   - Train the machine learning model
   - Evaluate and test the model

## Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset of SMS messages for training and testing. Ensure that the dataset is available in the required format (CSV or text file) and is placed in the appropriate directory. You can use popular datasets like the [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

## Results
- Detailed metrics of model performance will be displayed in the notebook after evaluation.
- Visualizations (if included) provide insights into the dataset and model behavior.
